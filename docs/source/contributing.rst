Contributing to Leiden
======================

The project is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/andrewhill157/leiden>`_ and can be cloned with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:andrewhill157/leiden.git

.. note::
    Even if you do not install the package, you must install in development mode or add the leiden package to your PYTHONPATH
    to use leiden (see :ref:`dependencies` page).

If you fork my project on Github, I will gladly review any pull requests. If you want your changes to be incorporated into
the main project, this is the best approach. Please include a detailed description with any requests.
